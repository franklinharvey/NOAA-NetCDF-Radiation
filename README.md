# NOAA-NetCDF-Radiation
NOAA's GMD (Global Monitoring Division) has a need to convert data dating back 40+ years to a modern data-type with metadata. The GMD has chosen the NetCDF filetype as the ideal filetype. Much of the data will be released through the [ObsPack distribution](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/obspack/ "NOAA's ObsPack Framework").
